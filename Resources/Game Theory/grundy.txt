Characteristics of the Nim-like Games (impartial games under normal play convention):
- 	Sequential. The players take turns one after the other, and there is no passing.
- 	Impartial. Given a state of the game, the set of available moves does not depend on whether you are player 1 or player 2.
- 	Perfect information.
-	Guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves.
-	There are no draws. 
	-	Normal Game - player unable to make a move loses.  
	-	Misère game - The last player to move loses.

States have the following properties:
1.	All terminal states are losing.
2.	If a player is able to move to a losing state then he is in a winning state.
3.	If a player is able to move only to the winning states then he is in a losing state.

To characterise losing states, find a property P such that:
1.	The eventual losing states (the ones from which no further move can be made) satisfies P.
2.	From a state that satisfies P, it is impossible to move to another state that satisfies P.
3.	From any state that does not satisfy P, it is possible to move to some state that satisfies P.
A state is now a losing state iff it satisfies P.

Sprague-Grundy theorem reduces the every state of a nim-like game to a single Nim pile of a 
unique size. This pile size is called the nimber/Grundy number of the state.

Grundy Number
- The final losing position corresponds to the empty Nim pile and has Grundy number 0.
- If we have calculated the Grundy numbers of all states we can move to, s1, s2 … sk, from the current state, s. Then,

Grundy(s) = mex({Gundy(s1), Grundy(s2) … Grundy(sk)}) = min({0, 1, …} - {Gundy(s1), Grundy(s2) … Grundy(sk)}) = smallest non-negative number which is not the Grundy number of any reachable state

- The Grundy numbers for each state can thus be enumerated recursively and the losing states are exactly those with Grundy number equal to 0.

Grundy Sum
-	A game composed of a collection of independently played nim-like games is nim-like as well. 
-	The grundy number of a state of the composite game is the XOR of the grundy number of the
	states of the subgames. This is called grundy sum.
-	Independently playable => the game is made up of subgames such that each player can choose
	to make a move in exactly one of the subgames at each step. Which one is upto the player.
